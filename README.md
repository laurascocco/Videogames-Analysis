# Videogames-Analysis

Welcome to my Video Game Data Analysis project! This project focuses on gathering, cleaning, and visualizing data related to video games. Using Python for web scraping from Metacritic for reviews and VGChartz for sales, followed by Power BI for data visualization, this project aims to provide insights into the video game industry.
