Project Overview
The project consists of the following main steps:

Web Scraping: Collecting data on video games from various websites.
Data Cleaning: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for analysis.
Data Visualization: Using Power BI to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Technologies Used
Python: Used for web scraping and data cleaning.
Power BI: Used for creating data visualizations.
Data Collection
The data was collected using Python's web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests. The target websites included popular video game databases and review sites.

Data Cleaning
After collecting the data, several steps were taken to clean and preprocess it:

Removing duplicates
Handling missing values
Normalizing text data
Converting data types
The cleaned data was then exported to a CSV file for further analysis.

Data Visualization
Power BI was used to create interactive and insightful dashboards. The visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the video game industry, including:

Sales trends
Genre popularity
Platform distribution
Review scores
